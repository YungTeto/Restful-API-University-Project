# Restful-API-University-Project
Development of a system to manage the database of a freelancing platform.

The assignment and a specification for the code come from my university. The project consists of the following steps:

  1. model the given situation as an entity-relationship-model
  2. transform this into a relation-model
  3. create a database schema with DDL statements and fill it with data.
  4. create a Restful-API application with connection to this database (only the controller), so that content can be queried, added, changed or deleted.
